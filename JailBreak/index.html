<h2>Jailbreak</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
	My game is original in its use of a collectathon style top-down game mixed with a stealth game. Players must collect all of the keys to escape. The player has the ability to use magic to make themselves invisible as well.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
	I personally am very proud of the invisibility mechanic that I implemented and the polish behind it. I had to do a lot of manipulating to the sprite to make it look ethereal, and it also took a bit of work to implement all the features that the invisibility included. My favorite however is the magicka bar that depletes as you use the ability.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
	I am very satisfied with out this first demo of the game turned out - it contains all of the features that I had wanted to include. I am especially happy with the invisibility mechanic. Dr. Gingold mentioned the idea to me in class, so I took the idea and ran with it. I changed the theme of the game from a modern prison to a medieval dungeon and gave the character a magicka resource. I would like to improve the guards in the future however. Currently, their vision radius are connected to their actual sprite, so therefore their turning is a bit wonky and faster than I wanted. I plan to make them seperate sprites but conenct them with a group later on.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
	The assets that were borrowed for this assignment were all of the sounds, the title screen background, and the player/guard sprites. However, I did a very large amount of editing to the sprites I downloaded. The tile set and the key sprites, as well as all of the gui elements (buttons, menus, magicka bar) were created by me.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
	This is the first digital iteration of this project, so therefore my closest other game would be my physical prototype. I learned a few things from the physical prototype: A player needs to be able to move at the same time as the guards if they guards are going to walk a set path, otherwise it won't be challenging. To make the game hard, I had to increase the number of guards. Lastly, I also learned that I needed some option for the player to hide from the guards if they were in a tough spot, but without it making the game too easy.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
	You are a wizard who has been thrown in jail; use your magic and stealth to escape from the dungeon!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
	Since there was no required theme for this game, the theme that I came up with was Prison Break.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
	Mandated variety is not required for this assignment.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
	I had a few mechanics that I was evaluating for this prototype. Firstly was the invisibility mechanic, which worked perfectly. Secondly was the mechanic one delivering keys one at a time - this proves to be difficult to do in the game! Lastly, I was evaluating the detection of the player by the guards if they are not invisible - this could use a little work.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
	I would like the players to experience a fun, but slow paced game. It is very challenging and this is on purpose, it should give the anxious feel of breaking out of the prison. It honestly may be a little too difficult, and I will decrease the difficulty if there are any complaints.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
	The player's goal is to collect all of the keys and bring them to the main door to escape the dungeon. However, the catch is that the play can only carry one key at a time, and there are multiple keys scattered throughout the dungeon! Many many guards roam the dungeon, and if you get caught you are returned to your cell and all the keys are taken back to their spots (game over!). You can move your character with wasd, and you can press the e key to toggle your invisibility power. Be careful though, you only have a limited amount of magicka! The bar at the top left shows you how much remains.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
	Take things slow, and avoid the guards. Do not do anything risk, because if you are caught you have to restart. Don't leave your invisibility on for long! Just toggle it to pass through an enemy and then turn it off.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
	The game takes place in a medieval era, in a world full of  magic. You play as a trickster wizard who was arrested for some petty crime that resulted from a prank of his. Obviously he can't stay and serve his sentence though, he is a wizard! Use your powers to conceal yourself and attempt to escape, so that you can continue your pranks!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
	Anyone who likes difficult games, stealth games, or top down games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
	If you play through without getting caught it only take a couple minutes. However, if you get caught you have to restart! If you aren't careful you will be restarting a lot..
