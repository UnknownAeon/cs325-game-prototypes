<h2>Jailbreak</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
	My game is original in its use of a collectathon style top-down game mixed with a stealth game. Players must collect all of the keys to escape. The player has the ability to use magic to make themselves invisible as well.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
	I personally am very proud of the invisibility mechanic that I implemented and the polish behind it. I had to do a lot of manipulating to the sprite to make it look ethereal, and it also took a bit of work to implement all the features that the invisibility included. My favorite however is the magicka bar that depletes as you use the ability.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
	I am very happy with how this second iteration turned out! I managed to implement all of the features that I could think of adding for the second iteration and the game seems to still feel like the same game that it was before. I am very happy with how the magicka circles turn out as well, and the way that they block off the magicka usage. I also am very happy with them, because I managed to find a way to create a circular physics body for them, so there is no overlap unless the player is actually touching the circle! Lastly, although they are simple, I am very happy with how the "wizard guards" turned out. It seemed like it would be easy to create an enemy that just rotated, but since they sprites are not the same size for each direction, it took a bit of manipulating to make sure the sprite wasn't moving around with each turn.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
	The assets that were borrowed for this assignment were all of the sounds, the title screen background, and the player/guard sprites. However, I did a very large amount of editing to the sprites I downloaded. The tile set and the key sprites, as well as all of the gui elements (buttons, menus, magicka bar) were created by me.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
	<p>Since this is the second iteration of my digital prototype, the clostest game would be the first iteration! In this version of the game I have added two new levels that include a number of new features/mechanics. The game smoothly transitions between the levels whenever you complete one, and losing a level takes you back to the beginning of the level rather than the beginning of the game.</p>
	<p>What was added:
		<ul>
			<li>Added a magicka vial item. Picking it up restores a small amount of magicka. You cannot go above the cap of 100 though, so do not pick it up when you are full!</li>
			<li>Added portals on the ground in some locations. The portals will teleport you to the matching portal elsewhere on the level. There are four colors: blue, red, green, and orange. When a portal is used it becomes a gray and musst recharge - this only take a moment, it was added to ensure you didn't instantly teleport back. Level 2 contains two portals, level 3 contains all 4.</li>
			<li>Added a "magicka lock" circle. In level 3 there are blue circles with runes on them. Standing on these circles will disable your ability to use magicka and turn invisible. A noise will sound and a lock will appear on your magicka bar to signify you cant use it.</li>
			<li>Added "wizard guards". In level 3 there are yellow guards that look like the player. They are the guards that created the magicka circles. They stand in one place (on magicka circles), and they do not move. They will change the direction they are looking once every 3 seconds or so.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
	You are a wizard who has been thrown in jail; use your magic and stealth to escape from the dungeon!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
	Since there was no required theme for this game, the theme that I came up with was Prison Break.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
	Mandated variety is not required for this assignment.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
	I had a few mechanics that I was evaluating for this prototype. Firstly was the invisibility mechanic, which worked perfectly. Secondly was the mechanic one delivering keys one at a time - this proves to be difficult to do in the game! Lastly, I was evaluating the detection of the player by the guards if they are not invisible - this could use a little work.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
	I would like the players to experience a fun, but slow paced game. It is very challenging and this is on purpose, it should give the anxious feel of breaking out of the prison. It honestly may be a little too difficult, and I will decrease the difficulty if there are any complaints.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
	The player's goal is to collect all of the keys and bring them to the main door to escape the dungeon. However, the catch is that the play can only carry one key at a time, and there are multiple keys scattered throughout the dungeon! Many many guards roam the dungeon, and if you get caught you are returned to your cell and all the keys are taken back to their spots (game over!). You can move your character with wasd, and you can press the e key to toggle your invisibility power. Be careful though, you only have a limited amount of magicka! The bar at the top left shows you how much remains.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
	Take things slow, and avoid the guards. Do not do anything risk, because if you are caught you have to restart. Don't leave your invisibility on for long! Just toggle it to pass through an enemy and then turn it off.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
	The game takes place in a medieval era, in a world full of  magic. You play as a trickster wizard who was arrested for some petty crime that resulted from a prank of his. Obviously he can't stay and serve his sentence though, he is a wizard! Use your powers to conceal yourself and attempt to escape, so that you can continue your pranks!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
	Anyone who likes difficult games, stealth games, or top down games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
	If you play through without getting caught it only take a couple minutes. However, if you get caught you have to restart! If you aren't careful you will be restarting a lot..
